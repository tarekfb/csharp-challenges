## 1. Variables and Console Output
- Declare three variables: one for your name (String), one for your age (int), and one for your favorite color (String).  
- Assign appropriate values to them.  
- Print all values to the console.  

---

## 3. If Statements and Comparisons
- Declare two int variables.  
- Use an `if` statement to check if the first number is greater than the second. Print a message if true.  
- Check if two strings are equal (case-sensitive). Print a message if they match.  
- Compare an integer to 100 and print whether it's greater, less than, or equal.  

---

## 4. String Operations
- Given `final String input = "Hello, Beginner!";`, modify it to get `"BEGINNER"` using string methods.  
- Store the result in `final String answer`.  
- Ensure `System.out.println(answer.equals("BEGINNER"));` prints `true`.  

---

## 5. Loops
- Print numbers 1 to 10 using a `for` loop.  
- Print even numbers from 2 to 20 using a `while` loop.  
- Print "Hello" 5 times using a `do-while` loop. Also print the iteration you are currently on.  

---

## 6. Using `for-each`
- Create an array of numbers `{2, 4, 6, 8, 10}`.  
- Use a `for-each` loop to print each number.  

---

## 7. Methods and DRY Principle
- Create a method `printMessage(String message, int count)` that prints a message multiple times.  
- Call it with `"Hello"` and `3`.  
- Ensure the code is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).  

---

## 8. Classes and Objects
- Create a `Person` class with fields `name` (String) and `age` (int).  
- Instantiate a `Person` object and assign values to its fields.  
- Print the `name` and `age`.  

---

## 9. Using `record`
- Rewrite the `Person` class as a `record` type.  
- Instantiate it and print the `name` and `age`.  

---

## 10. Getters, Setters, and Fields
- Create a `BankAccount` class with a private field `balance` (double).  
- Add a `deposit` method to increase the balance.  
- Add a `withdraw` method that only allows withdrawal if enough funds exist.  
- Ensure `balance` can't be directly modified.  

---

## 11. Finding Data in Collections
- Create an array of numbers `{1, 3, 5, 7, 9}`.  
- Write a method that checks if a given number exists in the array.  
- Return `true` if found, `false` otherwise.  
- Use a loop.  

---

## 12. Using `contains()`
- Rewrite the previous task using a `List` and the `contains()` method instead of a loop.
